                                                The working directory for this command is the container's root directory('/').
                                                Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported.
                                                If the shell is required, it must be explicitly invoked in the command.


                                                A successful execution is indicated by an exit status of 0; any non-zero status signifies a failure.

                                                This allows the action to utilize the specified container's resources without executing within it.


                                                The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.

                                                The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:


                                                - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Any` or `All`, this field will be ignored.
                                                - When `targetPodSelector` is set to `Role`, only those replicas whose role matches the `matchingKey`
                                                  will be selected for the Action.

                                                This is useful when there is no default target replica identified.
                                                It allows for precise control over which Pod(s) the Action should run in.


                                                If not specified, the Action will be executed in the pod where the Action is triggered, such as the pod
                                                to be removed or added; or a random pod if the Action is triggered at the component level, such as
                                                post-provision or pre-terminate of the component.

                                            Currently, this is only applicable to the `postProvision` action.


                                            The conditions are as follows:


                                            - `Immediately`: Executed right after the Component object is created.
                                              The readiness of the Component and its resources is not guaranteed at this stage.
                                            - `RuntimeReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component object has been created and all associated
                                              runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                                            - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                              This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                                            - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                              This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                                                The working directory for this command is the container's root directory('/').
                                                Commands are executed directly without a shell environment, meaning shell-specific syntax ('|', etc.) is not supported.

                                                This allows the action to utilize the specified container's resources without executing within it.


                                                The name must match one of the containers defined in `componentDefinition.spec.runtime`.

                                                The impact of this field depends on the `targetPodSelector` value:

                                                  will be selected for the Action.

                                              runtime resources (e.g. Pods) are in a ready state.
                                            - `ComponentReady`: The Action is triggered after the Component itself is in a ready state.
                                              This process does not affect the readiness state of the Component or the Cluster.
                                            - `ClusterReady`: The Action is executed after the Cluster is in a ready state.
                                              This execution does not alter the Component or the Cluster's state of readiness.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
